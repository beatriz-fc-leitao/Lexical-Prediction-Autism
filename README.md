# 📚 Lexical Prediction in Autism

This project contains R scripts used for data cleaning and analysis for my undergraduate dissertation on lexical prediction in autistic adults. In this context, lexical prediction refers to one's ability to predict upcoming written or spoken words. 

🇺🇸 I began working on this project at the Harvard Lab for Developmental Studies during my placement year, where I designed the methodology for the study and collected all data. 

🇬🇧 I then finished the project at the Univerity of Bath, where I submitted it as my final dissertation

## 🌍 CONTEXT:
To facilitate language comprehension, neurotypical individuals use contextual information to predict upcoming words. For instance, upon hearing the phrase ‘at night she locked the’, they are likely to predict the upcoming word: ‘door’. However, it remains unclear whether individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can make these same predictions. 

## 🔬 THE STUDY:
The current study tested for differences in autistic and neurotypical adults’ ability to use local sentence context and global discourse context to make linguistic predictions about upcoming words. Neurotypical (n = 30) and autistic (n = 71) adults completed a task in which they predicted upcoming missing words in a written story. Missing words belonged to one of three conditions such that they were either predictable based on context from the preceding sentence, predictable only when context from the broader preceding discourse was considered, or completely unpredictable. 

## 💡 FINDINGS:
Results showed that autistic participants made more correct predictions than neurotypical peers when words were predictable based on context from the preceding sentence. There was no difference in performance between the two participant groups when words required context from the broader preceding discourse to be accurately predicted or were unpredictable. The study also explored whether task performance was associated with individual differences in ASD symptomatology, language ability, and low-level prediction. Language ability was the best predictor of task performance across both participant groups. 

## 📝 MAIN CONCLUSION:
It was concluded that linguistic prediction is not impaired in ASD and that this process relies heavily on language ability.
